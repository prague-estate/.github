## :WIP: Prague estates project
Hello and welcome!

If you ever tried to find an appartment in Prague, you know how complicated it can be...
All the best offers are gone in 15 minutes! You found cool appartment posted 10 min ago and you are 30th applicant! 
So, you have to check new adds every few minute... or use out bot!

@PragueEstateBot

It will do all boring work for you and send you most recent ads right to your Telegram.
You can set up filters:
 - rent or sale mode
 - max price
 - appartment's layout
 - district  
and receive only the ads that are relevant to you. 

IF you want to keep an eye on all the ads, you can join these channels:
@prague_estate_rent
@prague_estate_sale
