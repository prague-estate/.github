Hello and welcome!

🔎🏠 If you ever tried to find an appartment in Prague, you know how complicated it can be...   
- 🙁 All the best offers are gone in 15 minutes!  
- 😖 You found cool appartment posted 10 min ago and you are 30th applicant!  
- 😫 So, you have to check new adds every few minute...  

or
  
use our bot! 😌

[@PragueEstateBot](https://t.me/PragueEstateBot)

It will do all boring work for you: collect from most popular sources and send to you **most recent ads**.  
Right to your Telegram. 

😎  And you even can set up filters:
 - rent or sale mode
 - max price
 - appartment's layout
 - district

and receive only the ads that are relevant to you.
